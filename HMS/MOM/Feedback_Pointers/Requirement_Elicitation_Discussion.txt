As discussed in the Elicitation workshop we are going to update the new feature
In this feature, we are going to add the "Office Staff" module in the place of "Nurse" role
The main Role of the "office Staff" is to take the details of the persons who joined in the hospital 
as the emergency case and also to do the mandatory first aid when the new patient joins the hospital
